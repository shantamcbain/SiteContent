<p>We have been looking for some time in a way to reward users for entering content. Having discovered steemit! We are looking to add  Cryptocurrency to our site. </p>

<p>To fund this process we offer Bitconnect <a href="https://computersystemconsulting.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=CSC&page=BitCoinInvestment" target="_blank" onmouseover="Click for more information.">referrals</a>.</p>

<p>First step is to add Cryptocurrency as  a payment method such as PayPal. Not as easy as one might think. We use WHMCS as our billing software because of its integration into cPanel/WHM interface. This is the software our hosted user's use to interact with their hosted website. or reseller account.</p>

<p>Next we will try to incorporate it into the core of the site. Doing so will allow all users to get paid for the content produced. Ever up vote will Get up for the entry regardless if you are the 'owner of the site' or a user. </p>
<p>There are many routes to taking advantage of this depending on your expertise and your available help. You now have two options at this time.</p>
