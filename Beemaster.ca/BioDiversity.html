<h2>Bio Diversity</h2>

<p>What the heck dose that mean. Simply put it is the quality and variation of available food sources. This is the area that is only beat out for stress in the hive by chemical contamination. The more availably and greater variates of uncontaminated food sources The healthier your bees will be. </p>

<p>In this database we will be adding information on pollen identification so you can see what your girls are bringing home. We set up one hive in each yard to collect the pollen. From this we can see on a plants the girls are foraging from and feeding the bees.  The entire harvest is preserved in a freezer for later count and annualized for contaminates. </p>
