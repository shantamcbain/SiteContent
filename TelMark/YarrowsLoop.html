<h2>Yarrow's Loop</h2>

<p>In the course of exploration of the snowshoe area we have discovered and tracked this loop. I would rate this as a blue or intermediate route. Most of the up hill track is on a gradual sloping road with a views on the way. Mostly of interesting clearing in the forest.

<p>Yarrow's Loop starts at the parking lot and basically fallows the logging road in. The farther you go the less road and more track it becomes. At the end of this the trail goes down the hill to the left. Down the hill through challenging terrain then connects to another logging access road that provides some nice down hill turns. The trail then dumps on the main vehicle access road. Where we started.</p>
