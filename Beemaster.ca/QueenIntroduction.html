<h2>Queen Introduction</h2>

<p>As beekeepers we will be required to do this many times. There are many ways to do so.</p>

<ol>
 <li><h3>Caged Queen</h3>
  
  <p>There are many types of cages in use. Two examples are the  JzBz cage and wooden boxes. Some are plugged with queen candy, some a with a cork. The process is relatively simple. We want the queen protected from the bees in the hive for a long enough time to get her pheromones around the hive so when she is released from the cage they will not kill her. This process takes around 4 days. </p> 
  
     <ul>
      <li><h3>JzBz cage</h3>. <p>You place the Queen cage between the frames 90 degrees to the frames, candy up and about 1/2 to 3/4 of and inch below the top bar. Move the frames together to ensure the cage will not shift. We want more time exposed to the bees so the end of the candy has been covered with a cap or electrical tape. This cap is removed 1 or 2 days after introduction.  </p>
      <p><h3>Wooden boxes</h3> are a traditional way of caging a queen. They may be candied or corked. General y there is only a screen on one side. Make sure the screen is not blocked when you place it between the frames. remember cover the candy remove when timing allows for about 4 days.</p></li>
     </ul> 
 </li>
 <li><h3>Papered</h3> In our operation we teach creating next years queen in May and June. This practice keeps a stock of spare queen in reserve over the course of the year and ensures a good base of new queens for over wintering. New queens are better at over wintering have faster spring build up This also places your queen production in the time of the year that bees will be doing it naturally. I you have queens in nucs you can simply find the queen put the frame she is on in a papered top box. Once accepted you can return the frame to the mating nuc which has already started the process of creating a new queen.</li>
 <li><h3>Acceptance check.</h3> You will want to go into the hive about  5 or six days and check for acceptance. No need to find the queen just look for eggs.</li>
