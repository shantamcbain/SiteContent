<h2>Varoa control discussion</h2>

<p>You bring up a point of importance here. Food sources are the best way to get treatments in the hive.  I too think that thyme pollen is a better way to get the effect into the mite. Ie feed the larva with pollen that comes from the plant. Yet this in theory may work but it, like the whole hype about mites being the course of of problem so kill them anyway you can. It distracts you to something you can see, the mite, from something you can't see The overall health of the organize that live in any given hive. I believe the unnecessary introduction of any chemical or food for that mater disrupts the balance in the hive. They principal is the same for any ecosystem.

<p>Over the years since American spread this pest to all corners of the continent. Which eventually lead to the closure of the border to American packages. <a href="<a href="beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&page=page=CCD" target=_blank">CCD for details</a> is a historical problem with beekeepers as it is vastly understood. Varroa came at a time.This gave the chemical businesses the perfect scape goat for they problems they are causing in the eco system.</p>

<p>The sustainable point of view on mites is keep them in check so the levels are not at a level that will stress the hive. Due to the fact that our bees have to live in an environment that is becoming more hostile them. As you read in the article on CCD it is a stress disorder. Stress is the cause of CCD and Varroa can contribute to that stress.</p>

<p>Become all that we do to our hives, smoke them, feed them, move frames around, introduce treatments. All these things create stress. These things we have direct control over. To reduce the stress in the hive here we need to weigh the actions we do in the hive to help the hive by restoring balance in the hive.</p>

<p>The vary first step of the process is determine if you actually have a problem and therefor a need for intervention. <a href="beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&page=HiveEvaluation" target="_blank"> Hive evaluating</a> Is were one starts.
