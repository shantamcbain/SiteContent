<h1>We now have 4 frame nucs for order.</h1>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we have worked out availability and price with our members to offer 4 frame nucs for order. These nucs are produced by beemaster.ca members or selected outside suppliers.</p>
<p>Numbers are limited. Please act quickly to ensure you get yours. <a href='https://www.computersystemconsulting.ca/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&pid=33' target='_blank'>Order at.</a></p>

<h2>This week with the bees.</h2>				

<h2>Why we recommend feeding bees!</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Ensure adequate feed for the bees.</li>
 <li>We ensure that the majority of available feed is free from chemicals</li>
 <li>As we want the new comb they will draw is free from chemicals. Feeding will help to reduce contamination. It will also ensure that there is always feed to draw the comb once they start. Feed interruption will lead to misshaped comb.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<p>Today is crunching the data we collected from last visits stats. From this we will build/repair equipment to fill the need.  We will also be prepaing the equipment and suppies for the <a href="https://beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&session_id=PJDTX7VDL5FHKCPV&page=EarthHeartColective" target="_blank" name="Anu Collective workshops" title="Click here for the Anu collective">Anu Collective</a> workshops on the may long weekend. We will be preparing for site selection and setup. Nuc creation and introduction, basic queen rearing and hive evaluation.</p>
<h2>Wednesday </h2>
<p><p>Today we will be making creating the cells needed for the <a href="https://beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&session_id=PJDTX7VDL5FHKCPV&page=EarthHeartColective" target="_blank" name="Anu Collective workshops" title="Click here for the Anu collective">Anu Collective</a> workshops. We will be using the cloake board method. we will work our hive and graft larvae to have enough cells for the nuc making and Queen rearing portion of the workshop. If you would like to join us in the yard <a href="https://www.computersystemconsulting.ca/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&pid=99" target="_blank" name="Spring Queen and yard expansion  series.">register here</a>. </p>

Each time visit the bees we will go through every frame in the hive looking at and recording in our database what we see. As we will be removing bees, brood and resources from each hive. These also will be recorded.</p>  
<p>Last week we created mating nucs with out cells to show how you can create queens. We will gothrough them to see how many cells they have drawn. Please join us by <a href='https://www.computersystemconsulting.ca/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&pid=99' target='_blank'>Signing up for our workshop</a>. We will be starting at around noon weather permitting. This workshop will be in our Grindrod yard.</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p>We will start our day evaluating the data received from the yard yesterday. We will be planing our next few weeks of beekeeping. We will be expanding the the hive management system available to all paid members of beemaster.ca </p> 

<p>Next we be in the shop repairing, cleaning equipment, mixing feed etc for our next visit with the bees.  We will ensure that we have the equipment cleaned repaired and ready for next weeks visit to the yard when we will make them up. As we are doing this we will up dating the queen system to include a grafting calendar.</p>

<h2><a href='/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&page=EarlySpring'>Early Spring Evaluation</a></h2>		
				
<p>We will be providing equipment and feeds to obtain the population leaves of your base operations. I you are a breeder and looking maximize your bees and brood you will be feeding pollen patties, combs of honey and/or sugar.  If your interest is pollination and/or honey production you will want to be cautious about build in too much brood or you will have swarming problems. Your goals are to have just the right number of brood and bees for an easy stress free season. Our spring workshops cover these principals in action. 
</p>
<h2><a href='http://beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&page=QueenAndBroodProductionW'>Queen and brood production.</a><html>


<p> <a href='http://beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&view=WorkShopsView'>WorkShop</a>  link for details.</p>

<p>Feeding our bees has become even more important than what we once thought. Bee's depend on a diverse flow of food sources for maximum health. Planting plants that we need for pollinators to thrive on. When the diversity is missing and/or contaminated Disease will result in your hives.</p>
<p>
<h2>Pollination products</h2>
<p>There is a great demand for pollination of crops. Your bees may be in the location for only a few days or they many be in a permanent yard.</p>
<p>All beekeepers will be doing this to one degree or another. There are strategies for a beekeeper with one hive to many hundreds for a commercial operations.</p>
<h2>Early summer Management</h2>
<p>Queen rearing over for this season now we are into fallowing the food stage of beekeeping. With the change in the weather and agricultural timing. Loss of pasture can be both man made and natural. In the man made category the harvest of alfalfa leads us to Sundays workshop. One of our yard is located in a 70 or so accrue field. It all came down at once and just at flower so the girls got no crop again this year. There will be enough food around for the smaller developing hives. but the large mains we have here will miss any honey crop they had built populations for. Look for more details in the workshop link.</p>
