<h2>Speculation in crypto currency</h2>

<p>As with all currencies there are fluctuations in value in on a moment by moment basis. With strategic buying low and selling high. One can gain more coins. There are many that consider this a part of the problem with the old system. We do. The daily cost to consumers is eminence. Bit Coin price shows the negative effect of this. It is no longer a medium of exchange but just a point of speculation. Especially when the primary use of the coin is a medium of exchange. Bitconnect is an example that is just a ponzi and no longer exist.</p>

<p>There is an agreement put forward by the speculators. They chose to invest. This is entirely untrue. Yes the speculators did. But not the consumer attempting to purchase a product. They are the ones forced to pay the constantly changing value. Yes there maybe one transaction that they made a bit but for the most part they lose. Both in the exchange rate and the commissions for the transfer.</p>
<p>A stable currency is essential for the future of our current cash based economy and the eventual transition to a not cash based economy.</p>
