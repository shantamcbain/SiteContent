<p>We will be providing equipment and feeds to obtain the population leaves of your base operations. I you are a breeder and looking maximize your bees and brood you will be feeding pollen patties, combs of honey and/or sugar.  If your interest is pollination and/or honey production you will want to be cautious about build in too much brood or you will have swarming problems. Your goals are to have just the right number of brood and bees for an easy stress free season. Our spring workshops cover these principals in action.

<p>Feeding our bees has become even more important than what we once thought. Bee's depend on a diverse flow of food sources for maximum health. Planting plants that we need for pollinators to thrive on. When the diversity is missing and/or contaminated Disease will result in your hives.</p>
<p>
<h2>Pollination products</h2>
<p>There is a great demand for pollination of crops. Your bees may be in the location for only a few days or they many be in a permanent yard.</p>
<p>All beekeepers will be doing this to one degree or another. There are strategies for a beekeeper with one hive to many hundreds for a commercial operations.</p>
<h2>Early summer Management</h2>
<p>Queen rearing over for this season now we are into fallowing the food stage of beekeeping. With the change in the weather and agricultural timing. Loss of pasture can be both man made and natural. In the man made category the harvest of alfalfa leads us to Sundays workshop. One of our yard is located in a 70 or so accrue field. It all came down at once and just at flower so the girls got no crop again this year. There will be enough food around for the smaller developing hives. but the large mains we have here will miss any honey crop they had built populations for. Look for more details in the workshop link.</p>
