<p>At <a href="http://beemaster.ca" target="_blank">http://beemaster.ca</a> we use pallets in all our yards. Pallets organize your hives for reducing drift, elevating for ease of working and can be leveled with ease. Having the hives in 4 pack also makes moving easier  with a lift. They can be winter packed as well. Watch for our coming videos on how to setup your yards and winterizing.</p>

<p>When setting up your station for working you will  first place a box just to the side of the entrance in the orientation of the box you will place the box to work Place one less boxes as the hive has. If you have 3 boxes place two support boxes. Take of the  lid and place it on the first box. The inner cover on the next. </p>

<p>Now crack and remove the top box and place it on the inner cover of furthest support box in your arc. Place the next box in the stack on the up turned lid on the first support box. This will keep the boxes in order when you put them back. The lid prevents the queen from falling in the grass if she drops of the bottom of the frames. </p>

<p>Separating the boxes like this puts them all at the same level for working from your seat. It also prevents the queen from running between boxes making her almost impossible to find. It also reduces the chance of rolling the queen. Once found you know which box she is in.</p>
