<h2>This week with the bees.</h2>				


<ol>
 <li>Ensure adequate feed for the bees.</li>
 <li>We ensure that the majority of available feed is free from chemicals</li>
 <li>As we want the comb they will draw is free from chemicals. Feeding will help to reduce contamination. It will also ensure that there is always feed to draw the comb once they start. Feed interruption will lead to misshaped comb.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>Today we will do our first evaluation of a new yard! we will go through every frame in the hive looking at and recording in our database what we see. We will be feeding the bees. We feed in our area because the feed is not prolific. It is also contaminated by Agra biz. By feeding we accomplish the fallowing.</p>
<p>This is one of our mentors yards. We will be featuring his yard in several upcoming online presentations. ending with wrapping yard for winter.</p>
<h2>Wednesday </h2>

<p>We will be in the shop repairing, cleaning equipment, mixing feed etc for our next visit with the bees. </p>

<p> <a href='http://beemaster.ca/cgi-bin/index.cgi?site=BMaster&view=WorkShopsView'>WorkShop</a>  link for details.</p>

<p>Feeding our bees has become even more important than what we once thought. Bee's depend on a diverse flow of food sources for maximum health. Planting plants that we need for pollinators to thrive on. When the diversity is missing and/or contaminated Disease will result in your hives.</p>

<p>There is a great demand for pollination of crops. Your bees may be in the location for only a few days or they many be in a permanent yard.</p>
<p>All beekeepers will be doing this to one degree or another. There are strategies for a beekeeper with one hive to many hundreds for a commercial operations.</p>
<h2>Early summer Management</h2>
<p>Queen rearing over for this season now we are into fallowing the food stage of beekeeping. With the change in the weather and agricultural timing. Loss of pasture can be both man made and natural. In the man made category the harvest of alfalfa leads us to Sundays workshop. One of our yard is located in a 70 or so accrue field. It all came down at once and just at flower so the girls got no crop again this year. There will be enough food around for the smaller developing hives. but the large mains we have here will miss any honey crop they had built populations for. Look for more details in the workshop link.</p>
